# Eclipse Arrowheadâ„¢ Core C Libraries

This repository gathers C99 libraries officially developed by the Eclipse
Arrowhead project. These libraries build on top of the C99 standard library to
provide cross-platform asynchronous I/O as well as support for various encodings
and protocols. It is also meant to provide code for directly dealing with the
provision and consumption of Arrowhead services, even though no such libraries
have been implemented at the time of writing.
